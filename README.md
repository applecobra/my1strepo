tutorial

This is my first time using git. I have been learning html and css on codecademy for 2 weeks.  I watch videos on you youtube and they led me here :)

I will add more to this once I figure out what the hell is going on!

From Youtube video:  Testgithub is a repository for showing the bare minimums of github and how to manuever, function,etc.
